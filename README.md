# Three-particle-systems-with-mouse
I'm nearing the end of Series 4 in the Nature of Code. I hope this program is optimized better than the first one.
So, this dispalys three separate particle systems left, center and right, and the mouse pointer repulses any particles that are near it when the mouse is pressed.

Version 4 now has round, square and triangular particles, the triangles and squares rotate.
